This term was used to describe organized groups of any size, ranging from legitimate bandits to the poor. Although many labelled this were found to have stolen goods and money, the charges focused primarily on petty thievery of no major consequence."

#~ msgid "Debate_007_034_enemy_2"

#~ msgid "Debate_007_034_zack"
#~ msgstr "I understand a lot of this is hearsay, but we've been asking many people to confirm this. "

#~ msgid "Debate_007_034_enemy"

#~ msgid "Debate_007_035_choice"
#~ msgstr "Yes"

#~ msgid "Debate_007_035_zack"

#~ msgstr "In general? Someone?"

#~ msgid "Event_031_246"
#~ msgstr "Yeah. A merchant. :break:Found him yesterday. Talked things out and so on."

#~ msgid "Event_031_247"
#~ msgstr "Why would you be looking for a merchant?"

#~ msgid "Event_031_248"
#~ msgstr "I uh- run a food bank back in Vuni, and help out with a stall. :break:Anyways. Talked to him about shipments and stuff yesterday."

#~ msgid "Event_031_248_2"

#~ msgid "Event_031_249"

#~ msgid "Event_033_100"

#~ msgid "Event_033_110"
#~ msgstr "I guess... "

#~ msgid "Event_033_120"
#~ msgstr "Alright, fine."

#~ msgid "Event_034_110"

#~ msgid "Event_034_130"

#~ msgid "Event_034_140"

#~ msgid "Event_034_150"
#~ msgstr "Sorry, officer, but do you mind not hanging around outside my house?"

#~ msgid "Event_034_160"
#~ msgstr "Oh, I'm sorry about that?"

#~ msgid "Event_034_170"
#~ msgstr "Thanks. "

#~ msgid "Event_034_180"
#~ msgstr "Oh and... can you not sit or hang around anyone else's for that matter?"

#~ msgid "Event_034_190"
#~ msgstr "Uh- Sorry to butt in, but is there a reason?"

#~ msgid "Event_034_200"
#~ msgstr "Hm?"

#~ msgid "Event_034_210"
#~ msgstr "We just got into town."

#~ msgid "Event_034_220"

#~ msgid "Event_035_205"
#~ msgstr "Tag along with us and in return the office here will help you out."

#~ msgid "Event_035_210"
#~ msgstr "That's a great offer, but-"

#~ msgid "Event_035_215"
#~ msgstr "Then it's settled!"

#~ msgid "Event_035_220"

#~ msgid "Event_035_250"
#~ msgstr "Oh shush, dear."

#~ msgid "Event_035_260"
#~ msgstr "Zack will be joining us as a ‘local guide' since we are ‘so very out of our natural element and may get lost'. "

#~ msgid "Event_035_270"
#~ msgstr "Got it?"

#~ msgid "Event_035_280"
#~ msgstr "Alright. All's well and good so let's go!"

#~ msgid "Event_035_290"
#~ msgstr "Any chance I can still say no?"

#~ msgid "Event_035_300"
#~ msgstr "Welcome to the team."

#~ msgid "Event_035_310"
#~ msgstr "Zack and Luke joined Leila's party."

#~ msgid "Event_041_590"
#~ msgstr "Yeah."

#~ msgid "Event_041_600"
#~ msgstr "In that case, all three of us will head :h:east to Wiska Forest:/h:."

#~ msgid "Event_041_610"
#~ msgstr "Understood."

#~ msgid "Event_041_620"
#~ msgstr "Yep."

#~ msgid "Event_041_630"
#~ msgstr "Then let's go."

#~ msgid "Event_045_060"
#~ msgstr "Now, now Zack. "

#~ msgid "Event_045_070"
#~ msgstr "Sometimes you don't have those available."

#~ msgid "Event_045_080"
#~ msgstr "So listen close, ok?"

#~ msgid "Event_045_090"
#~ msgstr "Zack learned First Aid."

#~ msgid "Event_045_100"
#~ msgstr "Luke learned First Aid."

#~ msgid "Event_045_110"
#~ msgstr "So now you know what to do, right?"

#~ msgid "Event_045_120"
#~ msgstr "It's basically the same as what they teach at-"

#~ msgid "Event_045_130"
#~ msgstr "No, no, you see there are actually quite a few differences, first of all-!"

#~ msgid "Event_045_140"
#~ msgstr "Um, Leila, shouldn't we hold this off for another time?"

#~ msgid "Event_045_150"
#~ msgstr "Oh, yes, you're right."

#~ msgid "Event_045_160"
#~ msgstr "Then let's go."

#~ msgid "Event_046_055"
#~ msgstr "and if we can, :h:find out who's leading the group:/h:. "

#~ msgid "Event_050_050"
#~ msgstr "You sure you're alright?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_060"
#~ msgstr "I'm fine, I'm fine. Both you and Leila are too worried."

#~ msgid "Event_050_070"
#~ msgstr "You look like you're about to drop dead."

#~ msgid "Event_050_080"
#~ msgstr "And you :skew:aren't:/skew:?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_090"
#~ msgstr "I'm not the pencil pusher here."

#~ msgid "Event_050_100"
#~ msgstr "Anyways. "

#~ msgid "Event_050_110"
#~ msgstr "Zack, you said you had something to do in Wiska Forest, but what :skew:was:/skew: it? :break:Didn't you say you were just looking for information? :break:Why would you need to go there?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_120"
#~ msgstr "Well, I figured that was my best shot at finding it. :break:After all, we found those letters."

#~ msgid "Event_050_140"
#~ msgstr "But, couldn't you have just waited for an official statement?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_150"
#~ msgstr "By the time that happened, the bandits would've already changed how they were doing things. :break:Besides, who's to say all the details would even be there. :break:Those bandits've been there for a long time. :break:Do you really think the military would include that?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_160"
#~ msgstr "A-Anyways, it was important for me to see it myself."

#~ msgid "Event_050_170"
#~ msgstr "I'm just glad Leila let me tag along. :break:I wouldn't know what to do if she actually put her foot down."

#~ msgid "Event_050_175"
#~ msgstr "I still can't believe she broke regulation."

#~ msgid "Event_050_176"
#~ msgstr "And that you even suggested it in the first place!"

#~ msgid "Event_050_180"
#~ msgstr "Well, all's well that ends well. :break:We got rid of all those bandits, so there shouldn't be any more problems."

#~ msgid "Event_050_190"
#~ msgstr "I wonder..."

#~ msgid "Event_050_200"
#~ msgstr "Those two seemed to be pretty important..."

#~ msgid "Event_050_210"
#~ msgstr "Yeah..."

#~ msgid "Event_050_220"
#~ msgstr "Don't worry."

#~ msgid "Event_050_230"

#~ msgstr "Yeah..."

#~ msgid "Event_050_250"
#~ msgstr "Yeah."

#~ msgid "Event_050_260"
#~ msgstr "You can count on me."

#~ msgid "Event_050_270"
#~ msgstr "And if you ever need help, Leila'll be there."

#~ msgid "Event_050_280"
#~ msgstr "I wouldn't put that much faith in her."

#~ msgid "Event_050_290"
#~ msgstr "Well, don't you both seem chipper?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_300"
#~ msgstr "Luke, we've been told to head back to base."

#~ msgid "Event_050_310"
#~ msgstr "Understood."

#~ msgid "Event_050_320"
#~ msgstr "And this time you absolutely cannot come along, Zack."

#~ msgid "Event_050_330"

#~ msgid "Event_050_340"
#~ msgstr "As long as you understand. "

#~ msgid "Event_050_350"

#~ msgid "Event_050_360"
#~ msgstr "Well, I have my own things to do too."

#~ msgid "Event_050_370"
#~ msgstr "Actually, what will you be doing from now on?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_380"
#~ msgstr "I think I'm going to go speak with the Lord here. :break:About the letters and bandits and such. :break:He'll probably get a report from you guys, but... :break:I guess you could say the civilian perspective is a bit different."

#~ msgid "Event_050_390"
#~ msgstr "Won't it be hard to meet with him though?"

#~ msgid "Event_050_440"
#~ msgstr "Actually!"

#~ msgid "Event_050_450"
#~ msgstr "Y'see, he holds public consultations every day up in his villa :h:north of town:/h:. "

#~ msgid "Event_050_460"
#~ msgstr "You wouldn't think it, but he's quite the friendly old man."

#~ msgid "Event_050_470"
#~ msgstr "You're from the southern base how do you even :skew:know:/skew: that."

#~ msgid "Event_050_480"
#~ msgstr "Listen, a woman needs to know a lot to get by in life."

#~ msgid "Event_050_481"
